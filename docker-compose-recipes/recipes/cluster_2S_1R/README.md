# ClickHouse cluster cluster_2S_1R

2 ClickHouse instances leveraging 3 dedicated ClickHouse Keepers

2 Shards with no replication configured

By default the version of ClickHouse used will be `latest`, and ClickHouse Keeper
will be `latest-alpine`.  You can specify specific versions by setting environment
variables before running `docker compose up`.

```bash
export CHVER=23.4
export CHKVER=23.4-alpine
docker compose up
```

This Docker compose file deploys a configuration similar to [this
example in the documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/architecture/horizontal-scaling) with the main difference being that 3 independent ClickHouse keeper instances are used in this recipe (instead of just one as in the docs).
See the docs for information on terminology, configuration, and testing.
