# Average Ether Costs over Time

Extracted from the [most popular notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mrisdal/visualizing-average-ether-costs-over-time) for this dataset on Kaggle. We originally rewrote this query to include a left anti-join, although this [doesnâ€™t appear to be required](https://gist.github.com/gingerwizard/f3f6f7bcec5bf6ba62763b75e4385c89). The more optimized version of the query is therefore used:


## BigQuery

```sql
SELECT
	SUM(value / POWER(10, 18)) AS sum_tx_ether,
	AVG(gas_price * (receipt_gas_used / POWER(10, 18))) AS avg_tx_gas_cost,
	DATE(block_timestamp) AS tx_date
FROM transactions
WHERE (receipt_status = 1) AND (value > 0) AND (block_timestamp > '2018-01-01') AND (block_timestamp <= '2018-12-31')
GROUP BY tx_date
ORDER BY tx_date ASC
```

## ClickHouse

```sql
SELECT
	SUM(value / POWER(10, 18)) AS sum_tx_ether,
	AVG(gas_price * (receipt_gas_used / POWER(10, 18))) AS avg_tx_gas_cost,
	toStartOfDay(block_timestamp) AS tx_date
FROM transactions
WHERE (receipt_status = 1) AND (value > 0) AND (block_timestamp > '2018-01-01') AND (block_timestamp <= '2018-12-31')
GROUP BY tx_date
ORDER BY tx_date ASC
