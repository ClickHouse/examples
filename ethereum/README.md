# Ethereum

Contains queries for the Ethereum block chain dataset available in [sql.clickhouse.com](https://crypto.clickhouse.com/?query=U0hPVyBUYWJsZXMgZnJvbSBldGhlcmV1bQ&).

Read the accompanying blog post on [Migrating a multi-TB dataset from ClickHouse to Big Query data](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-bigquery-migrating-data-for-realtime-queries).

These queries were originally provided for BigQuery and have been migrated and optimized for ClickHouse.

## Loading data

Data can be loaded in [batch](./batch/README.md) (once-off or scheduled) or continuously [streamed](./streaming/README.md).
### Batch

#### Schemas
- [Blocks](./batch/schemas/blocks.md) - Blocks are batches of transactions with a hash of the previous block in the chain.
- [Transactions](./batch/schemas/transactions.md) -Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network e.g. transferring ETH from one account to another.
- [Traces](./batch/schemas/traces.md) - Internal transactions that allow querying all Ethereum addresses with their balances.
- [Contracts](./batch/schemas/contracts.md) - A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

#### Loading with Beam

#### Loading CSVs from blob storage

### Streaming

#### Schemas
- [Blocks](./streaming/schemas/blocks.md) - Blocks are batches of transactions with a hash of the previous block in the chain.
- [Transactions](./streaming/schemas/transactions.md) -Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network e.g. transferring ETH from one account to another.
- [Traces](./streaming/schemas/traces.md) - Internal transactions that allow querying all Ethereum addresses with their balances.
