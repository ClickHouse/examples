# Ethereum

This directory contains examples that demonstrate how store and query Ethereum data in ClickHouse.

Read the accompanying blog post: [Migrating a multi-TB dataset from ClickHouse to Big Query data](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-bigquery-migrating-data-for-realtime-queries).

If you just want to play with the data, you can try it live at [crypto.clickhouse.com](https://crypto.clickhouse.com/?query=U0hPVyBUYWJsZXMgZnJvbSBldGhlcmV1bQ&).

## Storing data

ClickHouse supports both batch and streaming workflows.

The [batch](./batch/README.md) directory contains table schemas and examples of loading the Ethereum data set in batches.

The [streaming](./streaming/README.md) directory contains table schemas and examples of loading the Ethereum data set as streams.

## Querying data

The [queries](./queries/README.md) directory contains examples of queries that can be run on the Ethereum dataset.
