# Ethereum

Contains queries for the Ethereum block chain dataset available in [sql.clickhouse.com](https://sql.clickhouse.com/play?user=play#U0hPVyBUQUJMRVMgSU4gZXRoZXJldW0=).

Read the accompanying blog post on [Migrating a multi-TB dataset from ClickHouse to Big Query data]().

These queries were originally provided for BigQuery and have been migrated and optimized for ClickHouse syntax. For each, we provide the original BigQuery syntax and ClickHouse equivalent. We welcome contributions and improvements.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following tables (schemas and loading instructions are linked):

- [Blocks](./schemas/blocks.md) - Blocks are batches of transactions with a hash of the previous block in the chain.
- [Transactions](./schemas/transactions.md) -Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network e.g. transferring ETH from one account to another.
- [Traces](./schemas/traces.md) - Internal transactions that llow querying all Ethereum addresses with their balances.
- [Contracts](./schemas/contracts.md) - A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Queries

Note some of the following are pending ClickHouse implementations. Contributions welcome.

- [Top Ethereum Balances](./queries/top_balances.md)
- [Number of addresses with non-zero balance over time](./queries/non_zero_balance.md)
