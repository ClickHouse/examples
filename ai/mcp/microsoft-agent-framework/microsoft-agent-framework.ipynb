      "\n",
      "High-level yearly summary (rough period: late‑2020 → 2025 YTD)\n",
      "- Sales (counts): 2020: 306,857 | 2021: 1,279,406 | 2022: 1,073,122 | 2023: 854,549 | 2024: 859,960 | 2025 (YTD): 376,633\n",
      "  - Note: 2021 shows a very large spike in transactions (policy/market effects such as the stamp‑duty holiday and COVID-era timing likely contributors).\n",
      "- Average sale price (mean): 2020: £384,740 → 2021: £389,331 → 2022: £414,053 (peak) → 2023: £404,796 → 2024: £390,879 → 2025 (YTD): £362,283\n",
      "  - Yearly changes (mean): +1.2% (20→21), +6.4% (21→22), −2.2% (22→23), −3.4% (23→24), −7.3% (24→25 YTD)\n",

      "\n",
      "By property type (selected highlights)\n",
      "- Detached (highest priced): avg peaked in 2022 (~£521k) and remains the priciest; median detached price rose from £375k (2020) to £415k (2025 YTD) — roughly +10.7% over the period.\n",
      "- Semi‑detached: median from £235k → £270k (≈ +14.9%).\n",
      "- Terraced: median from £198k → £227k (≈ +14.7%).\n",
      "- Flats: median roughly flat-to-down (2020 median £230k → 2025 YTD £227k, small decline).\n",
      "- “Other” category shows very high means (around £1.1m–£1.3m) but lower counts — this category can contain mixed/atypical transactions and skews the overall mean; treat with caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interpretation / takeaways\n",
      "- Peak in mean prices occurred in 2022. Since then the mean has fallen (especially into 2025 YTD), while the median has been relatively stable around £275k–£281k. That pattern suggests some cooling at the high end (fewer ultra‑expensive sales), while the “typical” property price has been less volatile.\n",
      "- Transaction volume spiked in 2021 and then settled down — the 2021 spike is consistent with policy-driven shifts (e.g., temporary stamp‑duty changes and pandemic timing).\n",
      "- House types (terraced, semi, detached) generally saw meaningful median increases (~10–15%), whereas flats have not kept pace and show weaker performance.\n",
      "- 2025 figures are year‑to‑date (partial) and therefore not directly comparable to full calendar years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caveats\n",
      "- My query used the uk_price_paid* tables (the official Land Registry Price Paid style data in this DB). It covers registered residential transactions but may exclude some private unregistered exchanges or specific exclusions; new‑build treatment depends on is_new/dataset specifics.\n",
      "- 2025 numbers are partial (to today). If you want full‑calendar comparability, ask for calendar years or specify start/end dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like next steps, I can:\n",
      "- Re-run for calendar years (e.g., 2020–2024) or last 5 full years.\n",
      "- Produce month‑by‑month time series or charts (median and mean).\n",
      "- Break down trends by region/county/town or postcode area.\n",
      "- Exclude the small “other” category or focus on owner‑occupied vs leasehold, etc.\n",
